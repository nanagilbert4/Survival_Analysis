# Survival_Analysis

Classification, Regression and Clustering has been carried out on two datasets (clinical dataset and gene sequencing dataset). There are 6 jupyter notebooks. 3 for each dataset.
The notebook Gene_Class has all the exploratory analysis carried out. That notebook gives a clear understanding of both dataset hence the datasets weren't explored again in the other notebooks. The notebooks that start with Gene_ are work on the genomic dataset and Cl_ for clinical dataset
